# CRESSignalStructure

A Python library for modeling CRES (Cyclotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy) signals, currently just in waveguides. This package provides tools for simulating electron behavior in magnetic traps, calculating electromagnetic field distributions in waveguides, and computing the resulting power spectra from combining the above.

## Overview

CRES is a technique used to measure the energy of electrons through the cyclotron radiation they emit when trapped in a magnetic field. This library models the physics of:

- Electron traps with various magnetic field configurations made up of a number of current loops
- Waveguide electromagnetic field distributions (currently just the TE11 mode of a circular waveguide but with further expansions planned)
- Relativistic particle kinematics
- Power spectrum calculations for CRES signals

## Features

- **Flexible Trap Models**: Support for both analytic field forms and for fields generated from arbitrary current loops
- **Electromagnetic Field Calculations**: Accurate mode field distributions in waveguides
- **Relativistic Particle Physics**: Full relativistic treatment of electron kinematics
- **Power Spectrum Analysis**: Calculate frequency spectra for analytical and numerical traps
- **Vectorized Operations**: NumPy-based implementations for efficient numerical computations

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- pip

### Install from Source

Clone the repository and install the package:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CRESSignalStructure.git
cd CRESSignalStructure
pip install -e .
```

### Install with Testing Dependencies

```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of calculating a CRES power spectrum:

```python
from CRESSignalStructure import HarmonicTrap, CircularWaveguide, Particle, PowerSpectrumCalculator

# Create a harmonic trap with magnetic field parameters
trap = HarmonicTrap(B0=1.0, L0=0.2)  # B0 in Tesla, L0 in m

# Create a circular waveguide (TE11 mode)
waveguide = CircularWaveguide(radius=0.005)  # 5mm radius

# Create an electron with specific energy and pitch angle
particle = Particle(
    mass=9.10938e-31,      # electron mass in kg
    charge=-1.602176e-19,  # electron charge in C
    kinetic_energy=18.6e3, # 18.6 keV
    pitch_angle=1.5        # radians
)

# Calculate power spectrum
calculator = PowerSpectrumCalculator(trap, waveguide, particle)

# Get peak frequencies for the fundamental (order=0)
freq = calculator.GetPeakFrequency(order=0)
print(f"Cyclotron frequency: {freq/1e9:.3f} GHz")

# Get power in the fundamental peak
power = calculator.GetPeakPower(order=0)
print(f"Power: {power_plus*1e15:.3f} fW")
```
